1, a fun adventure. Perfect facilities available while there. I also enjoy stunning views. Beautiful views to shoulder the sunset. Will recommended to friend to go their when the were a holiday timr to enjoy every moment there             
2, As an extended family  we went for a two night retreat at Resorts World tourist hotel over the Christmas weekend and stayed at tourist for the first night. It was very spacious and clean.
3, Booked this hotel for the 3rd time in 4 years and it doesnt disappoint. The rooms are spacious and clean  and facilities are good. It is centrally located in tourist hotel so its very accessible. Will definitely return again.            
4, Came here for short break. The stay was quite present  hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Cooling and nice weather; the mall is renovated with lots more shops and eateries  rather convenient. A little pity that the theme park is still under construction.           
5, Check in process was quick and smooth  with friendly and welcoming Front Office personnel. We booked 2 rooms  and they were all good and clean. Excellent view from the hotel room where you will see the Awana Skyway cable cars in operation  and get excited        
6, Check-in was done within a reasonable time. Deluxe room comes with a nice mountain view. Lots of fresh air and pretty good environment for a relax vacations. Service staff were quite courteous and helpful.             
7, Decided to try this hotel out as a change to my usual preferred hotel  and was pleased with the overall stay. For those who are familiar with tourist hotel  all the hotels on top of  Highlands are interconnected.
8, Entered the spacious and clean lobby  it was very a good way to start the start. However  staffs at reception were not welcoming. Theres a cafe and convenience store at the lobby.
9, Have been going to tourist hotel once every few years and this time was quite disappointing. 
10, Hotel is decent with amenities in place. Not even a single wifi spotted in the hotel room. We had to use it in the lobby or starbucks. Pretty disappointed we were still early for the opening of the extension of tourist hotel.
11, I booked a deluxe room from Sydney for 3 nights paying $45 Australian dollars a night. When we went there - they asked us to do online check-in. We were offered a most filthy room. Room was so small with two single beds.
12, I cant imagine that this hotel does not provide any wifi in room? They only have it at the lobby.. wow.. no wifi?? Hotel Staff at the front desk service was terrible! Unfriendly and not professional at all.
13, I like this hotel very much compare to other hotels. This hotel has wider and bigger rooms than others. The staff of the hotel is very friendly and polite. This hotel is very value for money if there is a promotion available.
14, i liked the hotel ambiance and the lightings in the room. the room temperature is nice as it wasnt so cold. had a pleasant stay and good night sleep. location wise its a little far since we need to go through so many escalators to...             
15, I reserved the stay 10 days before arrival. Arrived at 5:30 pm  by that time my credit card was charged the whole stay already. I booked non smoking room  and I sent a reminder before arriving again. When checked in they gave 11 th floor.
16, I went there to have a bit quiet  but was very noisy. One side the huge blower of AC the other side the road. Was a bit dirty. The staff is unfriendly! The food in the  Cafe is just not good.
17, It was my second time in this hotel and definitely the last time. The hotel is below standards of 3 stars hotels and is disappointed to see this hotel getting same low standards as tourist Hotel. Toilet and rooms are smelly.
18, Less crowded as compare to the other hotels in tourist hotel area as it is a bit hidden away. Large king size bed  reasonable spacious   with two resting chairs  writing table  TV  fridge  coffee making facility  rain shower bath room.   
19, My friend and I had been staying at this hotel almost every month since last year. We like the hotel of the room space and the bed. Its is very comfortable. The only downside is the TV channels not so many to watch.
20, Nice hotel. I think there is a lot of new reception staff. So basically they r not properly train to answer your questions. This hotel is ok and comfortable to sleep  enough space for kids to have fun in the room.
21, Overall experience ok but in the morning around 7am i started to sweat while sleeping i think the Ac was off. Maybe because they thought the weather outside is so cold but in reality it is not.
22, Paid wifi access for guest. Had a huge reception but only few - like 4 to 5 operating counter. Seems to be at least more than ten years old unfurnished structure of the view from cable car. Nice geography curves surrounding the hotel.
23, Room was clean  bathroom was nice and contain transparent glass. No air cond but only fan. But it unexpected that we told by the staff after check out by phone calls around 3pm that the glass of the art has been broke after my stays.
24, Spend one night at this hotel and the room was more spacious than the one at tourist hotel. The hotel is not new though but well maintained and clean. The hotel has a coffee bean and tea leaf cafe at the lobby and check
25, Stayed 1 night 3 rooms. This seems to be the most obvious affordable hotel up there. The rest of the hotels seems to be overpriced. Rooms were surprisingly quite huge and clean. Bed was good. No aircon but the big ceiling fan was more than enough.
26, Stayed 2 nights with connecting rooms. Room is spacious. Toiletries are all provided. Theres also iron and hair dryer. Also a variety of tv channels. Downside is that there is no wifi in the rooms. Wifi is only located at lobby.             
27, Stayed here during weekday so as to avoid the crowd. Fast check in. The room was cozy and much more spacious compared to others. Everything is well maintained. Just that free WIFI is not available.             
28, The hotel is nice  for a night stay up on tourist hotel Highlands. We book this as its newly renovated. The room and bathroom is nice  clean. The services however is not 4 star. They dont help with luggage upon check in  during the stay theres...          
29, The Q at the reception was long and the auto check in machine does not cater to personal request which I submitted when booking through online. I had requested for a non smoking room but the guy at the reception was very slow in allotment.
30, The room is big with all the necessary amenities. It is walking distance to the tourist hotel main casino. Eateries are nearby. The staffs are friendly.   
31, The rooms are good enough for the price and the staff was very helpful especially who gave us connecting rooms. There is no breakfast and gym here. Also no Aircon in the room. Wifi is available only in the lobby. 
32, The rooms are ok try to book it online for good deals from their website. tourist hotel is more cheaper than this one... Yes the lobby of tourist hotel is very good. All hotels on tourist hotel are good. But if u on budget...             
33, The rooms in the hotel are well furnished  clean and with comfortable beds. However  the rooms near the outside concert arena can be very loud at night.
34, The staffs at tourist are really awesome! They are really friendly Have my two-day stay here and it is an awesome experience.          
35, There are a few hotels at tourist hotel. Stayed at the Resort. Checked in was smooth. The hotel room was basic. There was a fan in the room and with open windows you get a nice cool air. Room was situated in a very noisy area.
36, These old hotel still look good to stay. Comfort large bed and clean but furniture look so standard. Equiped with ceiling fan and flat tv  no aircon in room. Bathroom look clean with hot and cold shower.
37, This hotel has the best location compared to other hotels as it is convenient to access different restaurants/theme park. Omly downside was there was only wifi in the lobby which practically does not work. Maybe would consider staying here again. 7/10
38, This hotel was amazing the bathrooms is good and the bed is comfy but the thing that made me give 4 out of 5 is that there is no wifi in the hotel room but there is wifi on the lobby.
39, This is an interesting tour. The road trip is 1 to 2 hours and very interesting with a stop just below the tourist hotel. The rooms were clean and the service lady was really helpful
40, This is one of the Biggest Hotel at tourist hotels. They have big lobby with so many check in counter but still usually for individual customer we should queue. I have stayed so many time at this hotel  but last time i stay here on march.
41, tourist hotel is the place that I having fun  the hotel is very big and have everythings in one place.    
42, Very nice including shopping and good food. It was nice reading about how it started by one person who had visions about this island and now a good tourist attraction where people even go for their honeymoon.
43, We book directly from tourist website. Our family usually go tourist hotel once every 2 - 3 years. tourist we book a twin single bed room. The bed was Super single size. Trip from 17 Sept - 19 Sept 2016.
44, We got 2 connecting rooms which were clean and brightly lit. There is a convenience store and a Coffee Bean at the lobby. The hotel itself is located at a quieter part of tourist hotel which is perfect for a getaway from the noise in the...             
45, we stayed at tourist last month.A very nice centrally located hotel with very helpful staff.The rooms are very spacious and clean.Take a room with even number as they face the Sky Way and nice view of the valley.             
46, We stayed here on 13-15/10/2016. We got a room with hot water supply and no cold water supply. The front desk lady straight away changed our room to a more comfortable room at no charges. It was done so fast. Breakfast also so nice.
47, We stayed in the hotel from 4th to 6th June. We enjoyed the cool weather and natural air-conditioning. The room windows were left open to allow the natural air in. Hotel is linked to many other facilities such as the shopping centre  restaurants.
48, We tried to book a room through a link given by our organiser on August 16  but to no avail. We called  tourist hotel Reservation Line several times  again to no avail. As time is very near the function date  we had no choice.
49, We visited this property in the month of May-2009. Basically we were three couples and stay for two nights there  its good n spacious rooms. breakfast we see how they are going to manage the guest it’s awesome Salute to them.
50, we vist tourist hotel with my friends this wonderful resort biggest hotel at getting excellent mainte. aprox 6800 rooms and big dineg halls pubs and all.
51,"Horrible experience, pathetic service. There was no wifi in the room even after complaining a million times"
52,I loved the stay and will recommend this to my friends. The room was spacious given the price of it.
53,If  you seek slightly more in entertainment and comfort then I suggest you avoid the tourist hotel. The rooms unlike the picture are dirty  stained and reek.
54,The rooms were neat and we liked them so much but The lady at the reception was not at all helpful.
