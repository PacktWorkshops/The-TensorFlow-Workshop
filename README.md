## About The TensorFlow Workshop

[The TensorFlow Workshop](https://www.amazon.in/TensorFlow-Workshop-hands-building-real-world-ebook/dp/B095SN22Y4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+tensorflow+workshop&qid=1639029259&s=books&sr=1-1) teaches you how to build deep learning models from scratch using real world datasets with the Tensorflow framework. You will gain the knowledge to process a variety of data types, including tabular data that includes numbers and text, sequential data such as financial data, and images.

## What You Will learn
* Get friendly with various mathematical operations of TensorFlow 
* Pre-process a wide variety of data such as tabular, sequential, and images 
* Understand the purpose and usage of various deep learning layers 
* Perform hyperparameter tuning to prevent overfitting of training data 
* Use pre-trained models to speed up the development of learning models 
* Generate new data based on existing patterns using generative models
